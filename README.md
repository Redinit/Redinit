I’m a graduation student pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer Science, and an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a deep passion for hacking and security. I believe in learning the things I love and pushing myself to grow every day. Currently, my main focus is on the defensive side of cybersecurity, working towards becoming a SOC Analyst. Once I’ve built a strong defensive foundation, I plan to expand into offensive security to develop a well-rounded skill set. As a student, I’m committed to continuous learning, hands-on practice, and becoming a skilled and trusted professional in this field.

## Objective

To develop strong skills in defensive cybersecurity, become a SOC Analyst, and later advance into offensive security roles — with the ultimate goal of becoming great in this field.
